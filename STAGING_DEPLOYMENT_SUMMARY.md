# Backend Staging & Deployment - Assignment Summary

## Assignment Overview
**Student**: Alvin  
**Task**: Backend Staging & Deployment  
**Description**: Manage Django backend staging via existing CI/CD pipeline, edit pipeline to ensure deployment only occurs after tests pass, and ensure staging environment mirrors production.

  - Staging mirrors production configuration
  - Environment-specific logging and security settings
  - Database configuration validation
  - CORS settings for staging vs production

### 3. Testing Infrastructure Enhancement

  - `pytest.ini` - Pytest configuration
  - `conftest.py` - Shared fixtures
  - `apps/users/test_api.py` - Comprehensive API tests
  - `apps/pharmacies/test_api.py` - Pharmacy API tests
  - `apps/health/test_health.py` - Health check tests
- **Features**:
  - Added pytest integration alongside Django tests
  - Comprehensive test coverage for all endpoints
  - Database fixtures and test data
  - Authentication testing

### 4. Health Monitoring System
- **Files**:
  - `apps/health/` - New health monitoring app
  - Health check endpoints for deployment verification
- **Endpoints**:
  - `/health/` - Basic health check
  - `/health/detailed/` - Comprehensive health status
  - `/health/ready/` - Readiness check for deployments
  - `/health/live/` - Liveness check for monitoring

### 5. Deployment Documentation
- **File**: `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
- **Content**:
  - Complete deployment process documentation
  - Environment setup instructions
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Security considerations

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### CI/CD Pipeline Flow
1. **Test Stage** (runs on all pushes/PRs)
   - Install dependencies
   - Set up PostgreSQL test database
   - Run Django tests
   - Run pytest with coverage
   - Upload coverage reports

2. **Staging Deployment** (develop branch only)
   - Triggers only after tests pass
   - Deploys to Render staging service
   - Verifies deployment success

3. **Production Deployment** (main branch only)
   - Triggers only after tests pass
   - Deploys to Render production service
   - Verifies deployment success

### Environment Configuration
- **Staging**: `pharmalink-backend-staging.onrender.com`
- **Production**: `pharmalink-backend.onrender.com`
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Render managed)
- **Static Files**: WhiteNoise + CDN

### Testing Coverage
- **Django Tests**: 9 existing tests
- **Pytest Tests**: 25+ additional tests
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage reporting
- **Database**: PostgreSQL testing environment

## 🚀 Deployment Process

### Staging Deployment
```bash
# Push to develop branch
git checkout develop
git push origin develop
# GitHub Actions automatically runs tests and deploys to staging
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Merge develop to main
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push origin main
# GitHub Actions automatically runs tests and deploys to production
```

## 📊 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Conditional Deployment
- ✅ Deployment only occurs after all tests pass
- ✅ Separate staging and production deployment jobs
- ✅ Environment-specific configuration

### 2. Staging Mirrors Production
- ✅ Identical database configuration
- ✅ Same security settings
- ✅ Environment-specific logging
- ✅ CORS configuration differences

### 3. Comprehensive Testing
- ✅ Django test suite
- ✅ Pytest integration
- ✅ Coverage reporting
- ✅ Database testing with PostgreSQL

### 4. Monitoring & Health Checks
- ✅ Health check endpoints
- ✅ Readiness and liveness checks
- ✅ Deployment verification
- ✅ Environment validation

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Staging Environment
- Uses staging-specific secret keys
- More permissive CORS for testing
- Additional logging for debugging
- Environment variable validation

### Production Environment
- Uses production secret keys
- Strict CORS settings
- Minimal logging
- Security headers enabled

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

### Database
- Connection pooling enabled
- Query optimization
- Index optimization

### Static Files
- WhiteNoise compression
- CDN integration
- Cache headers

### Application
- Gunicorn workers
- Memory optimization
- Response compression

## 🛠️ Tools Used

### Required Tools
- ✅ **Render**: Django backend staging and production
- ✅ **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ **Python/Django**: Backend framework
- ✅ **PostgreSQL**: Database
- ✅ **Django testing tools**: pytest and unittest

### Additional Tools
- **WhiteNoise**: Static file serving
- **Gunicorn**: WSGI server
- **Codecov**: Coverage reporting
- **Pytest**: Advanced testing framework

## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Configure GitHub Secrets**:
   - `RENDER_API_KEY`
   - `RENDER_STAGING_SERVICE_ID`
   - `RENDER_PRODUCTION_SERVICE_ID`

2. **Set up Render Services**:
   - Create staging service
   - Create production service
   - Configure environment variables

3. **Test Deployment**:
